## 1. Introduction
### Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets 
Text Analytics is one of the dynamic and frequently used field of Data Mining and Machine Learning. In this project we tried to make prediction based on a test data, which lack labels. We tried to guess correctly the labels as much as possible. 





### Our approach
After defining several different data cleaner and preprocessing functions, we implemented for different type of models like: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Grid Search algorithm. We tried to observe the efficiency of these models under different data cleaner and preprocessing functions. One of the earlier conclusion was the fact that further cleaning like implementing stemming had a negatif effect on the result. 


## 2. Initial Setup
As a first step, the user is required to import the necessary libraries and packages as well as the datasets, which consist in the training and test set. Moreover, our team provides a set up to directly create submissions for the website AIcrowd and a brief description of the features in the present dataset.


# DMML2020_COOP

This folder contains the files and codes from our group project of "Disaster tweets", which was about the text analytics.

The code files contains codes for LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Grid Search algorithm.

Predictions were calculated and submitted. The files are under the directory "documents".
